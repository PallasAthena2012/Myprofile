          Hello, my name is Ilyannie!
          <br /><br />My journey began with the publication of my first short
          story, Pumpkin by Ilyannie T.G., in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
          Since then, my love for words has blossomed thanks to the newfound
          flexibility offered by my online school community, Washington Virtual
          Academies. From 2021 to 2023, I was named the three-time champion of
          the K12 National Spelling Bee. This passion eventually evolved into a
          profound interest in public speaking and debate, through which I
          received the Potomac Debate Tournament First Place Speaker Award twice
          in a row and represented Washington State at the 2024 National Civics
          Bee National Championship, harnessing it as a platform to raise
          awareness about the issue of gun violence. <br /><br />Beyond
          humanities, however, I am also an environmental advocate, having
          placed first at the 2024 K12 National Innovation Challenge after
          presenting my project, “Operation BioTide”, a Caroline D. Bradley
          Scholarship Finalist, an active member of my school's Associated
          Student Body, where I have spearheaded several programs including a
          Journalism Team and Civics Club. I have also received International
          recognition as a competitive pianist, having been awarded Silver
          Medals at the Bach and Charleston International Festivals and the
          Distinguished Gold Medal at the Classical International Viennese
          Festival. In 2025, my musical career came to a climax when I placed
          first at the Crescendo International Competition and had the chance to
          perform my debut solo at Carnegie Hall’s Zankel Hall. Looking ahead, I
          was recently accepted into the UW Robinson Center for Young Scholars,
          empowering me with the opportunity of a lifetime to pursue a one-year
          transition from middle school directly into college.
